# Vurtuality Website

Help me coding the Vurtuality Website! The home of a new community.
Vurtuality is making a switch. From now on Vurtuality will be focussing on supporting coders and the coding community.
We will be doing this by setting up various tutorials, forums and lots of information on how to code and how to improve your code.

I can't do this alone, so please help me. For this to work we need a big community that is wanting to help other people.
